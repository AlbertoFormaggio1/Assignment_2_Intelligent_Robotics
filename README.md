# Assignment_2_Intelligent_Robotics

The code available is responsible for moving Tiago in the environment.
Using the AprilTag library, once it has positioned in front of the table, the robot can detect the position and orientation of the objects on the table.
Then, these objects are converted into collision objects to allow tiago a smooth pick routine without colliding with obstacles.

Finally, Tiago identifies the cylinders positions and will place the object on the correct table.

The code and report for the project are available in this repo.
The video with a demo of the code can be found at: https://youtu.be/jsoZffZYnI0
